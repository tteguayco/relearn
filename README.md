# Relearn

----
## What is it?

**Relearn** is a software tool thought to help students when they are starting to learn Relational Algebra, which is a relational query language proposed by Edgar F. Codd in his 1970 paper called "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks".

This project has actually emerged as a web version of the existing [JITRAX](https://github.com/tteguayco/JITRAX), which was a end-of-degree project carried out in La Laguna University in the academic year 2016/17.
